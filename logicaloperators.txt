Logical Operators
1️⃣ && (Logical AND)

Both conditions must be true.

javascript

if (condition1 && condition2) {
  // Both are true
}
2️⃣ || (Logical OR)

At least one condition must be true.

javascript
if (condition1 || condition2) {
  // At least one is true
}
3️⃣ ! (Logical NOT)

Reverses the condition.

javascript
if (!condition) {
  // Runs if condition is false
}
📝 Example:
javascript
let age = 33;
let hasLicense = true;

// Check if the person is an adult and has a license
if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
    console.log("You can drive!");
} else {
    console.log("You cannot drive.");
}

// Check if the person is underage or doesn't have a license
if (age < 18 || !hasLicense) {
    console.log("You can't drive.");
}
💡 Key Points:
Combine &&, ||, and ! for complex conditions.

Use parentheses () to group and control the order of operations:

javascript
if ((age >= 18 && hasLicense) || (age >= 16 && hasLearnersPermit)) {
    console.log("You can drive.");
}
